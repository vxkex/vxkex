Introduction
============

VxKex NEXT is a set of API extensions for Windows 7 that allow some Windows 8, 8.1 and 10-exclusive applications to run on Windows 7.

**Performing the following operations before installing is recommended.**

- **Uninstall**
  - **0patch Agent**
    It might cause Chromium-based browsers and JetBrains IDEs to crash after enabling VxKex NEXT and running it.

- **Update**
  - **MacType â†’ 2025.6.9+**
    An old version of MacType might cause all programs to fail to start after enabling VxKex NEXT.

After installation, usage is easy. Here are the ways to enable VxKex NEXT:
1. Just right click on a program, open the Properties dialog, and select "VxKex" tab. Then, check the check box which says "Enable VxKex NEXT for this program", and try to run the program.
2. Find "VxKex NEXT Global Settings" from start menu and open it, click "Add" button, select a program, click "Open" button, and try to run the program.

Some programs require additional configuration. There's a file called "**Application Compatibility List.docx**" inside the VxKex NEXT installation folder (which is C:\Program Files\VxKex by default) which details these steps, but for the most part, all configuration is self-explanatory.

If you are a developer, source code is provided as a 7z file on the releases page.

The majority of Qt6 applications will work, and many Electron applications will work as well.

**Q: Does VxKex NEXT modify system files? Will it make my system unstable?**

**A**: VxKex NEXT does not modify any system files. Its effect on the whole system is extremely minimal. No background services are used, no global hooks are installed, and the shell extensions and DLLs that are loaded have minimal impact and can be disabled if needed. You can rest assured that your Windows 7 will remain as stable as it always is.

**Q: Do I need to have specific updates installed?**

**A**: Users of Windows 7 without any updates can still use it, but many programs require Service Pack 1, KB2533623 (DllDirectories update) and KB2670838 (Platform Update) in order to run. It is a good idea to install those updates.

**Q: If I have ESUs (Extended Security Updates) installed, can I use VxKex NEXT?**

**A**: Yes. There is no problem with ESUs.

**Q: Can I use this with Windows 8 or 8.1?**

**A**: Currently, VxKex NEXT is designed for use only with Windows 7. If you use Windows 8 or 8.1, VxKex NEXT will do nothing useful.

**Q: Can I remove VxKex or VxKex NEXT after upgrading to Windows 8/8.1/10/11?**

**A**: Yes. If VxKex is installed, update it to VxKex NEXT, then uninstall it from control panel.

**Q: How does VxKex NEXT work?**

**A**: VxKex NEXT works by loading a DLL into each program where VxKex NEXT is enabled. This is accomplished through using the IFEO (Image File Execution Options) registry key.

Specifically, the "VerifierDlls" value is set to point to a VxKex NEXT DLL. This DLL then loads into the process.

API extension is accomplished by editing the program's DLL import table so that instead of importing from Windows 8/8.1/10/11 DLLs, it imports VxKex NEXT DLLs instead. These VxKex NEXT DLLs contain implementations of Windows API functions which were introduced in newer versions of Windows.
